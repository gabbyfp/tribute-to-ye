<p>Ye more commonly known by his birth name Kanye West, is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several artists and developing the "chipmunk soul" sampling style. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music.

<br>
West, the child of a photographer and former Black Panther father and a college professor mother, grew up in Chicago and attended <a href="https://www.csu.edu/";">Chicago State University</a> for one year before dropping out to pursue a career in music. Early on he demonstrated his considerable abilities as a producer, contributing to Jermaine Dupri’s album Life in 1472 (1998) before relocating to the New York City area, where he made his name with his production work for Roc-A-Fella Records, especially on rapper Jay-Z’s album Blueprint (2001).
